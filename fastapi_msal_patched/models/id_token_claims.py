    It can be used to perform authorization checks safely, such as when the token is used to access a resource.
    By default, the subject claim is populated with the object ID of the user in the directory.

    A nonce is a strategy used to mitigate token replay attacks.

    This allows your app to verify the value against the value it specified on the request,

    Your app should perform this validation during the ID token validation process.
