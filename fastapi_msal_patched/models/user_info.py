    It can be used to perform authorization checks safely and as a key in database tables.
    This ID uniquely identifies the user across applications -
    two different applications signing in the same user will receive the same value in the oid claim.
    This means that it can be used when making queries to Microsoft online services, such as the Microsoft Graph.

    Since it is mutable, this value must not be used to make authorization decisions.
    It can be used for username hints, however, and in human-readable UI as a username.
